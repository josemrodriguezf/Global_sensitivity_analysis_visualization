### This repository has an R function to plot Sobol First Order, Total Order, and Second Order sensitivity indices. In this example I obtained the indices using SAlib python library (Herman et al, (2017), SALib: An open-source Python library for Sensitivity Analysis, Journal of Open Source Software, 2(9), 97, doi:10.21105/joss.00097) can be downloaded at https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Follow the example in the example folder.
